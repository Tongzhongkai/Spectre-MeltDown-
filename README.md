Spectre breaks the isolation between different applications. It allows an attacker to trick error-free programs, which follow best practices, into leaking their secrets. In fact, the safety checks of said best practices actually increase the attack surface and may make applications more susceptible to Spectre

Spectre is slightly different from Meltdown. This is so because it can allow hackers to fool the applications (even the stable versions of the respective application) running on a machine to give up secret information from the Kernal module of the operating system to the hacker with the consent or knowledge of the user.
